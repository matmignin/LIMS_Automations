# Changelog

### v1.100

* New setting: number of entries in "z. More history" (default 26 for a to z), repeating menu accelerators. Use a negative value e.g. -30 to avoid repeating menu accelerators.
* New setting: second Show Menu hotkey to be able to define mouse button for example (Winkey+LButton).
* If there are over 26 templates in a folder, repeating menu accelerators (a-z).
* New: Check if a sub-folder in \templates\ has a "settings.ini" with a "shortcut" key, if so, setup hotkey to show sub-templates menu directly by passing the main menu, templates, folder navigation.
* Now using CRC32 to avoid duplicate entries, hopefully faster and more efficient.
* Fix: Compact(ing) adding lines and crc to compacted history as well.

### v1.99.1

* Adding correct Settings GUI to Github

### v1.99

* New setting: Exclude programs so copied text will not be added to the clipboard history (useful for password managers for example).  
  A "*" is added to the Menu and "Cycle" tooltips for the first entry (a*.) to indicate the current clipboard has different content as to what is shown.  
  Selecting 'a*' will still paste the selected text, not the actual current clipboard.
* New setting: Lineformat (edit control under "Show Lines") \t placeholder for tab to right align, \l placeholder for number of lines.  
  Default: \t(\l line),\t(\l lines)
  Comma separated for single and multiple lines.
* New setting: Show "TrayTip" using OSDTIP_Pop when AutoReplace has been executed on a new clipboard entry.
* New setting: Auto Backup every X Minutes - automatically backup History. ClipChain, AutoReplace, and Slots only when there is an edit. Keep 5 most recent copies - saved as *.xml.bak in respective ClipData folders.
* Update XA - https://github.com/hi5/XA
* Fix ClipChain "Pause" should work correctly now while pressing hotkey (didn't work after v1.95 update of hotkey setup it seems)

### v1.98

* Modified XA to account for empty XML files due to previous instance of CL3 not being able to save XML data correctly (system crash, forced shutdown, etc) - https://github.com/hi5/CL3/issues/15
* Fix (attempt) error "This picture is too large and will be truncated" in Excel (Check for CF_METAFILEPICT in clipboard)
* oldtext, ttext cleanup ...

### v1.97

* New setting: CopyDelay to set time in milliseconds to wait before adding a copy of a new clipboard entry to the CL3 history.  
  This may resolve some conflicts when other programs or scripts access the clipboard.  
  Increasing this value may work around this issue.  
  The previously hardcoded PasteDelay (50ms) can now also be set.

### v1.96

* API: added CL3Api_State to turn clipboard history on/off - incl. changing tray icon
* Tray menu: Pause clipboard history - option to turn clipboard history on/off - incl. changing tray icon
* Change: Slots - Restore current clipboard from History after pasting Slot entry
* New option to paste unmodified clipboard entry, retains all formatting - see Note 3 in readme.md
* Added WatchFolder() to automaticallly reload CL3 when a file in the Template folder is updated/added/removed

### v1.95.2

* Fix: Changed to #If for ClipChain paste hotkey

### v1.95.1

* Fix: change "contains" to "in" for keylist in settings.ahk

### v1.95

* Change: Clipchain: you can now define a hotkey (via settings) to "progress to next item" - this will allow you to keep ^v for normal copy/paste functionality - see Clipchain HK (settings)
* Change: AutoReplace added "excel.exe" as fixed Bypass option to prevent errors. Ensure AutoReplace is always updated/saved - https://github.com/hi5/CL3/issues/13
* Fix: CheckHistory OnClipboardChange for first entry & clipboard now also uses == (see v1.94.4)

### v1.94.5

* Fix: FIFO activation via Hotkey trigger

### v1.94.4

* Fix: DispToolTipText removed StringReplace ;
* Change: Added Stringcasesense, On; also in Checkhistory as ==
* Change: Cycle through plugins: Insert changed clip vs overwrite/replace
* Change: (try) to keep original Icon of SOURCE of the clip vs where used LAST
* Change: CheckHistory now as label, no longer need to .remove entries in ClipboardHandler
* Change: move templates\01_Example.txt to res\ folder and check at startup if we have any templates, if not copy (avoids the need to remove it after each update)

### v1.94.3

* Fix: Not correctly updating lines of first entry after pasting from menu + adding Lines to other actions (api, ccmdr)

### v1.94.2

* Fix: Typo/syntax error notes.ahk plugin

* Changelog.md split from readme.md

### v1.93.1

### v1.93

* Hotkeys and some other basic settings via settings.ini, accessible via Tray menu Settings
* Basic stats, accessible via Tray menu "Usage statistics"
* Search Plugin: fix for first Down:: (see comment in code plugins\search.ahk)
* Search Plugin: pressing hotkey again toggles Gui (e.g. hide, show like slots and clipchain already do)
* Attempt to have more stable ToolTip (less/no flickering as it no longer continously updates the TT if nothing changes)  
  (Note: using ToolTipFont https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=4777 results in error for these cycle tooltips)
* Updated from OnClipboardChange: to OnClipboardChange() - improved efficiency by turning it on/off at various "actions" and "plugins"
* Improved MaxHistory, not just on OnExit but now continously keep it at set entries - should help with memory consumption and overall speed
* Added some (generic) icons to tray menu
* Fixed issue with Cycle paste not correctly updating History

* Make it so that we can push public updates without accidentally releasing QEDlg()

### v1.91

* Merge History items via search menu (select multiple, press <kbd>F5</kbd>)

* AutoReplace plugin: added Try

### v1.71

### v1.43

* Further refinement of "AutoReplace" plugin

### v1.42

* Further refinement of "AutoReplace" plugin
  - You can turn it on/off via the Tray menu, the checkmark indicates if it is Active
  - Should now retain formatted clipboard better when no replacements were made

### v1.2

* Menu: show icons of the program where text was copied from
* New standard Plugins:
	- Search history
	- Slots
